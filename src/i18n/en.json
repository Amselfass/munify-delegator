We are active nationwide and internationally in the field of political youth education and youth empowerment. Founded in 2003, and accredited as a non-governmental organization with special consultative status by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and the UNDPI since 2012, we organize political role-playing games in which young people between the ages of 15 and 21 simulate a United Nations conference. We also advocate for political youth education and the participation of young people in political processes at the international level."
